    2.0.0\r\n- Unified version, for all versions of Unity and pipelines.\r\n    -

    for missing shaders and runtimes.\r\n- Fixes for:\r\n    - HDRP shader recompiling.\r\n   
    - Wrinkle masks not being detected when installed in Assets.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nVersion
    2.0.0 for all versions of Unity 2020.3 to 6000.0 and all pipelines (HDRP / URP
    / 3D).\r\n\r\nTo upgrade, remove the old CC/iC Unity Tools entirely and install
    this with the package manager. It should also work if just dropped into Assets.\r\n\r\nThis
    package will install the shaders, template materials and run-time scripts into:
    **Assets/Reallusion/CCiC Unity Tools**.\r\n\r\nIt should also detect when the
    _wrong_ shader package is installed, or if any of the shaders are missing, for
    the version of Unity and pipeline and present options to fix this.\r\n\r\nThere
    are also functions to remove and install different shader packages if required."}]'
